		  Clothing/merchandise website
	............................................

	â€¢ Who is the client? 

	â€” A small clothing brand.  
	//         And/Or        //
	â€” A merchandise manufacturer.
	
	â€¢ Profit model:

	â€” Direct sales from the website.
	â€” Imo any other form of website monetisation would 
	be unnecessary and it would only ruin user experience.
	â€” If there are sponsors, their section is footer. 
	
	............................................

	â€¢ Functionality: 

	â€” Sell clothes ðŸ™„

	â€¢ Design/Features: 

	â€” The website should be consice, as few pages
	as possible. 
	
	â€” Prices are always shown on the first line of 
	item description.
	
	â€” Login, About, Contact and Item menus should be 
	designed as modal boxes.

	â€” Round corners everywhere!!! 

	â€” All the elements on my penicl drawn layouts are
	purposely made small-scaled to fit everything on screen.
	When actually doint the project,

	............................................
	
	â€¢ Personal notes: 

	â€” It's worth to try a couple of #item layouts: one with 
	description within the picture that appears on hover.
	After a while I thought that i might need to change it to
	always visible but half-transparent. On hover it would be
	fully visible. 
	â€” If that looks ugly I'll just make item descriptions 
	appear under the item pictures like every normal person.

	â€” I'm too tired to think of client's profile settings
	and page for it so i'll do it later ðŸ¥±ðŸ˜´
	Making a note so I don't forget!!!

	â€” I'll need to consider adding social media buttons.
